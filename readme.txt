python Perceptron.py <training_directory> <testing_directory> <number_iterations> <learning_constant> 

Example command line execution to execute with 1000 iterations and a .01 learning constant:

python Perceptron.py train test 1000 .01


Output: Learning Constant, Number of iterations, Number of correct predictions and the accuracy on the test set using the unfiltered data set and the filtered data set without any stop words.
